# CustomisedVirrtualFileSystem
It contains Source code and documentation on Customised virtual file system project
1. Name of the project : Customised Virtual File System project. 
2.Technology used : System programming in C. 
3.User interface used : CUI/CLI: Command User/Command Line Interface. 
4. Platform required : Windows NT platform OR Linux Distributions . 
5. 5. Hardware requirements : Intel 32 Bit Processor. 
6. 6. Description of the project: 
• In this project we emulate all data structures which are used by operating system to manage File system oriented tasks. 
• As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage. 
• In this project we create all data structures which required for File Subsystems as Inode Inode Table, File Table, UAREA, User File Descriptor Table, Super block, Disk Inode List Block, Data Block, Boot Block etc. 
• We provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc. • While providing the implementations of all above functionality we use our own data structures by referring Algorithms of UNIX operating system.
• By using this project we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform. Data structures used in the project. 7. Data structures used in the project: LinkedList. Array.
